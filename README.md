### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm an avid supporter of static typing, not just because of the safety it provides but also because a good tool is one with principles to build other tools on. My favourite thing about Typescript is the quality of the suggestions and the popup docs.

I'm currently studying towards a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Surrey.
