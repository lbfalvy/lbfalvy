### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm mostly working in React with Typescript these days, but I'm always eager to learn new and exciting stuff. My next learning target is something functional, maybe PureScript. I'm an avid supporter of static typing, not just because of the safety it provides but also because a good tool is one with principles to build other tools on. I'm currently studying towards a BSc in Computer Science at the University of Surrey.

I usually respond to emails in 3 working days.
