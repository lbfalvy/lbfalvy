All code published on my Github is written by me unless explicitly stated otherwise, and I don't use ML-based autocomplete. I cannot guarantee the same for dependencies, my tools, and the learning examples I find online.

- Mostly working in: Typescript, C#, Rust
- Other tools I use a lot: Docker, Node, TypeORM, Fastify
- Project of interest: [Orchid](https://github.com/lbfalvy/orchid)
